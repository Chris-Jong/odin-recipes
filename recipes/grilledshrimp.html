		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>20 leaves fresh basil, chopped</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
			<li>salt to taste</li>
			<li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
			<li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
			<li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>1 1/2 pounds roma (plum) tomatoes, chopped</li>
			<li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Mix basil, olive oil, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt in a bowl. Add shrimp and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
			<li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove shrimp from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
			<li>Cook shrimp on preheated grill until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
			<li>Melt butter in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat; stir in white wine and bring to a boil. Add heavy cream and Parmesan cheese; simmer until reduced, about 10 minutes. Stir in angel hair pasta, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese. Top with shrimp to serve.</li>
